cfml.us URL Shortening Extension for Alfred
============

A Shell Script so you can create a short URL using the cfml.us service from within [Alfred App](http://alfredapp.com/). You will need Alfred and the Powerpack to use this.

Installation

How to use

Once installed with Alfred you can run the following commands

    cfml.us [ URL to shrink ]

For example:

This will display a Growl Notification with the shortened URL.
The short URL will also be copied to the clipboard so you can quickly paste it wherever you need it.

    
Notes

All growl notifications copy the contents of the notification automatically to your clipboard.
